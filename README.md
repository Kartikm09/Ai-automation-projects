# AI Automation Projects – LinkedIn Bot & SAP GPT-4 Integration

Hi, I'm Kartik Mishra — a Master's graduate in Supply Chain Management with a strong focus on AI, and a Bachelor's in Information Technology.  
I'm passionate about AI-driven automation and have hands-on experience with no-code/low-code tools, Python automation, SAP AI Core, GPT-4, and enterprise tech.  
I love building smart bots and solving real-world problems using intelligent automation and next-gen tools.

This project repo showcases two real-world tools I personally built and use:

---

## 1. LinkedIn Auto-Apply Bot

**Problem:** Applying for jobs manually is slow and repetitive.

**Solution:**  
A bot that:
- Automatically applies to relevant jobs on LinkedIn
- Filters by job titles, experience, and location
- Customizes messages per job
- Runs locally on my system

**Tools used:** Python, Selenium, Browser Automation

## 2. SAP + GPT-4 Integration

**Problem:** SAP systems lack natural conversational interfaces.

**Solution:**  
I integrated SAP AI Core and GPT-4 to:
- Connect to live SAP S/4HANA backend
- Allow smart chatbot queries via SAP Fiori UI
- Deliver real-time data insights using GPT-4

**Tools used:** SAP BTP, SAP AI Core, SAP Launchpad, GPT-4 API
